CoffeeMachine.java
IngredientCalculator.java
Ingredients.java
IngredientTotals.java
InputHandler.java
OutputHandler.java

From user
amyWater
amtMilk
amyCoffeeBeans

InputHandler (Done)
- Prompt the user for the current quantities of water, milk, and coffee beans available

IngredientAvailability (Done)
Create an instance of Ingredient Availability with these amounts and initialise their instance variables
- Create an instance of maxCoffeeAvailable which will be calculated and updated when the constructor
 is called.
 - Create a method in ingredinet Calculator to make this amount and return it as an int



CreateCoffee
- Handles the creation of coffee by subtracting the amount of ingredients used from the available
ingredients. (Done)
- The coffee order class will call this class multiple times when creating coffee. The coffee order
class will need logic to make sure there is enough ingredients available(Done)

CreateCoffeeOrder
(Done)
- Constructor - Takes in an instance of available ingredients and initializes the instance variable.

- coffeeOrderHandler(IngredientAvailability, IngredientRequirements) -=
This method handles the logic for the coffee order. It takes in the rquest and the ingredients
avaiable.
Create vaiables for possible coffee and coffees required as we will need them to reference and for
calculations
It checks if the order can be completed. If it cannot it notifies the user and tells them how many cus it can make.
If it can make the exact amount, it tells taht this, if it can make more it tells them this.
Finally, if the coffe can be make, the ingredients need to be subtracted.


- isEnoughIngredients - This method should check that there is enough ingredients to make the coffee
 order.This method compare total possible coffees with the requirement about and return a boolean.
 (DONE)

- Calls creatCoffee method to subtract from the available ingredients when a coffe is created.
- A method that calculates coffees remaining after completing order.

i want a method handler for the coffee order. It should handle the logic behind if the coffeee order
 can be made or not
